# Key Takeaways
1. Worked with pygame for the first time and its attributes.
2. Was one of the most complex code I have done due to using pygame and building a functioning game in python.
3. Used many new methods like "if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]" when the user presses the right arrow key.
4. Had to plan out the different sizes of each item. Namely the player, missiles, and the terminal which the game is running on.
